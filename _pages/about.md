Biography
======
I received the B.S. degree (Honors Program) from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014 and the M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and  Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2017. I am currently working toward my Ph.D. degree at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA. My research interests are algorithm design and implementation for wireless networks. I'm particularly interested in handling uncertainty in wireless communications and networking area. In 2019, my paper "(Optimal Power Control with Channel Uncertainty in Ad Hoc Networks)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9020876]" won the Fred W. Ellersick MILCOM Award for the Best Paper in the unclassified technical program.

I was admitted to Southeast University at the age of 15. Before that, I skipped two years during high school at [Handan No.1 High School](http://handanyz.com/). At Southeast University, I was in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/), an honored college named after our famous alumna [Chien-Shiung Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung_Wu). After two years of Honorary Intensive Class in Informatics Track, I chose Information Engineering as my major and worked on wireless communication until today.
