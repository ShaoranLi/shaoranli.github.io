Hello, I'm Shaoran Li, a fifth-year Ph.D. student at ECE Department, Virginia Tech supervised by [Dr. Tom Hou](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/THou.html). I belong to the [Complex Networks and Security Research (CNSR) Lab](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/index.html). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

About me
======
I received the B.E. degree (Honors Program) from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014 and the M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and  Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2017. I am currently working toward my PhD degree at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA. My research interests are algorithm design and implementation for wireless networks.

Highlights
======
In 2019, I received the **Fred W. Ellersick MILCOM Award for the Best Paper in the unclassified technical program**. 

In 2010, I was **admitted to Southeast University at the age of 15**, which is 3 years earlier than the normal case. I'm sincerely grateful to my parents, friends, and teachers for their supports and for helping me overcome numerous challenges. 

At Southeast University, I was in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/), an honored college named after our famous alumna [Chien-Shiung Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung_Wu), a Chinese-American particle and experimental physicist. After two years of Honorary Intensive Class in Informatics Track, I chose Information Engineering as my major and worked on wireless communication until today.
