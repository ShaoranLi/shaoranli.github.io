Hello, I'm Shaoran Li, thanks for checking my personal website. Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer at NVIDIA, working on 5G/next-G wireless networks. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.


About me
======
I received my Ph.D. degree from ECE Department, Virginia Tech under the supervision of [Prof. Tom Hou](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/THou.html) in 2022. My research interests are algorithm design and implementation for wireless networks, with a focus on network uncertainty. Check our group [Complex Networks and Security Research (CNSR) Lab](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/index.html) for more exciting works. Before joining VT, I received the B.E. degree (Honors Program) from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014 and the M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and  Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2017. 

Highlights
======
In 2019, I received the **Fred W. Ellersick MILCOM Award for the Best Paper in the unclassified technical program**. 

In 2010, I was **admitted to Southeast University at the age of 15**, which is 3 years earlier than the normal case. I'm sincerely grateful to my parents, friends, and teachers for their supports and for helping me overcome numerous challenges. 

At Southeast University, I was in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/), an honored college named after our famous alumna [Chien-Shiung Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung_Wu), a Chinese-American particle and experimental physicist. After two years of Honorary Intensive Class in Informatics Track, I chose Information Engineering as my major and worked on wireless communication until today.
