**Summary**: My research interests are algorithm design and implementation for wireless networks. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the following two aeras:
- Handling uncertainty: Provide probabilistic guanratees in presense of random network parameters without distribution knowledge. E.g., Provide probabilistic interference threshold guarantee using the mean and covariance of random channcel gains.
- Real-time algorithm: Meet wall-clock timing requirement. E.g., 125 $\mu$s (one TTI in 5G-NR numerology 3) timing requiremnt for a scheduling and power control algoriothm.

I also closely collaborate with my colleagues to work on Age of Information, MIMO, Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) systems. In 2019, I received the Fred W. Ellersick MILCOM Award for the Best Paper in the unclassified technical program.
