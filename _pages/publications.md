## **Summary** 

My research interests are algorithm design and implementation for wireless networks. I’m particularly interested in the following two areas:
- Handling uncertainty: Provide probabilistic guarantees in presence of random network parameters without distribution knowledge. E.g., Provide probabilistic interference threshold guarantee using statistics or limited data samples of uncertain channel gains.
- Real-time algorithm: Meet wall-clock timing requirement. E.g., 125 $\mu$s (one TTI in 5G-NR numerology 3) timing requirement for a scheduling and power control algorithm.

I also closely collaborate with my colleagues to work on Age of Information (AoI), MIMO, Citizens Broadband Radio Service(CBRS), Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) systems. You can also find my publications on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=utvZzaAAAAAJ&hl=en).
