Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) system provides higher throughput and spectrum efficiency, which is pivotal in future communication. Traditionally in Nyquist system, orthogonality of shaping waveforms is required in order to avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI). However, ISI is permitted in FTN system and thus the advantages of nonorthogonal pulses can be utilized. In this paper, two innovative ones, namely EGF and Gaussian pulses, are designed in FTN system. Simulation results indicate that typical FTN system with EGF and Gaussian pulses obtains 1.9dB SNR gain compared with that of Raised-cosine pulse in case of 66.7% throughput gain. In addition, a practical FTN transceiver is proposed, in which complexity of MAP equalization is 94% reduced with the help of nonorthogonal waveforms.
