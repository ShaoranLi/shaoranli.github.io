**Abstract**: Underlay coexistence is a spectrum efficient mechanism to roll out 5G picocells within a macrocell on the same spectrum. Due to a lack of cooperation between the primary users (PUs) in the macrocell and secondary users (SUs) in the picocells, it is impossible to have complete knowledge of channel conditions between them. Under such a circumstance, chance-constrained programming (CCP) has been shown to be an ideal optimization tool to address such a channel uncertainty. However, solutions to CCP are computationally intensive and cannot meet 5G's timing requirement (125 $\mu s$). To address this problem, we propose a novel scheduler called GPU-based Underlay Coexistence (GUC) with the goal of finding an approximate solution to CCP in real-time. The essence of GUC is to decompose the original optimization problem into a large number of small subproblems that are suitable for parallel computation on GPU platforms. By selecting a subset of promising subproblems and solving them in parallel with fast algorithms, we are able to leverage GPU parallel computing and develop a real-time solution. Through extensive experiments, we show that GUC meets the 125 $\mu s$ requirement while achieving 90\% optimality on average.
